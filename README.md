# Hello World! 

I am an enthusiastic software developer. Based in Louisville, KY.  I aspire to create code that can bring art, and technology together and reach out to society. I am formally trained in the arts, and I am always looking for how to bring this into any piece of code I work on. I believe that art and technology can facilitate self-expression in todayâ€™s world.

I am an avid video game collector and enjoy many of the classics. My favorite console is the PS1, and I am looking to collect a complete collection of PS1 titles.
